# ADR 0018: Inter-Runtime Communication Protocol (IRCP)

## Component

Oasis Core, Oasis SDK

## Changelog

- 2022-10-13: Initial draft

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Currently each runtime is its own relatively isolated environment. It can
interact with the consensus layer via [incoming] and [outgoing] messages, but
a standardized way to communicate with other parallel runtimes sharing the same
consensus layer is missing.

This ADR proposes the Inter-Runtime Communication Protocol (IRCP) which enables
any two runtimes sharing the same consensus layer to securely communicate by
exchanging standardized packets. It also proposes modifications to the runtime
P2P network to support seamless relaying of messages without the need for any
external processes.

[outgoing]: 0003-consensus-runtime-token-transfer.md

## Decision

The following new concepts are introduced by this proposal:

* Each runtime can signal that a **connection** should be established _to_
  another runtime sharing the same consensus layer. For each unique destination
  runtime only one connection may be established.

* In the context of an established connection the runtime may establish one or
  more **channels**. Each channel can be used to send and receive ordered
  packets.

The transport of packets does not require any new interactions with the
consensus layer in order to make sure the protocol is scalable. Runtimes only
rely on the common consensus layer for packet authentication by using it as a
source of trusted state roots for all runtimes.

Actual packets are instead transported using a new topic within the existing
P2P pubsub system, similar to transactions.

### Connections

A connection structure represents metadata about a particular connection.

```golang
type Connection struct {
  cbor.Versioned

  // RuntimeID is the runtime identifier of the target runtime.
  RuntimeID common.Namespace `json:"runtime_id"`

  // MaxPacketsPerBatch is the maximum number of packets that can be put
  // together in a batch. Batches with more packets than that will be rejected.
  MaxPacketsPerBatch uint16 `json:"max_packets_per_batch"`

  // MaxProofEntries is the maximum number of proof entries that can be put
  // together when constructing a proof. Batches with more proof entries that
  // that will be rejected.
  MaxProofEntries uint16 `json:"max_proof_entries"`
}
```

### Channels

TODO: Channel metadata structure.

### Packets

An IRCP packet has the following structure.

```golang
// Packet is an IRCP packet used for transporting data between runtimes.
type Packet struct {
  cbor.Versioned

  // SeqNo is the packet sequence number.
  SeqNo uint64 `json:"seqno"`
  // AckNo is the acknowledgement number.
  AckNo uint64 `json:"ackno,omitempty"`
  // Src is the source runtime ID.
  Src common.Namespace `json:"src"`
  // SrcChannel is the source channel ID.
  SrcChannel uint64 `json:"src_channel"`
  // Dst is the destination runtime ID.
  Dst common.Namespace `json:"dst"`
  // DstChannel is the destination channel ID.
  DstChannel uint64 `json:"dst_channel"`
  // Height is the consensus layer height of when the packet was sent.
  Height uint64 `json:"height"`

  // Data is the runtime-dependent data that should be sent over the channel.
  Data []byte `json:"data"`
}
```

### Storage Keys

IRCP requires the runtimes to use pre-defined keys for storage in order to be
able to generate proofs of packets being sent.

The following storage keys must be used:

* **Connections.**
  ```
  "ircp" 0x01 dst-runtime-id
  ```

  Where `dst-runtime-id` is the serialized destination runtime ID.

  The value is the serialized `Connection`.

* **Channels.**
  ```
  "ircp" 0x02 dst-runtime-id src-channel-id
  ```

  Where `dst-runtime-id` is the serialized destination runtime ID and
  `src-channel-id` is the big-endian uint64 encoding of the channel ID.

  The value is the serialized `Channel`.

* **Outgoing packet queue.**
  ```
  "ircp" 0x03 dst-runtime-id src-channel-id seqno
  ```

  Where `dst-runtime-id` is the serialized destination runtime ID,
  `src-channel-id` is the big-endian uint64 encoding of the channel ID and
  `seqno` is the big-endian uint64 encoding of the packet sequence number.

  The value is the serialized `Packet`.

* **Reserved.**
  ```
  "ircp" 0x04-0x80 *
  ```

  The range between `0x04` (inclusive) and `0x80` (inclusive) is reserved for
  future protocol extensions.

### Authentication

Packets need to be authenticated before they can be processed. Authentication is
based on proving that certain storage keys (as specified above) have been set in
the source runtime (this proves that packets were actually sent).

The runtimes should leverage the existing consensus layer light client interface
as an oracle for getting trusted consensus block headers and from those block
headers the trusted state roots for particular runtimes.

Proofs are described by the following structures which facilitate batching of
multiple packets under one proof as long as there are no gaps in sequence
numbers.

```golang
// Proof is an IRCP proof.
type Proof struct {
  cbor.Versioned

  // Height is the consensus layer height of the proof.
  //
  // Note that the height of the proof can be higher than or equal to the height of when the
  // packet was sent since proofs can be refreshed.
  Height uint64 `json:"height"`
  // Entries are the entries of a proof.
  Entries [][]byte `json:"entries"`
}

// VerifiableBatch is a batch of verifiable IRCP packets used for transporting data between
// runtimes. Multiple packets may be combined and covered by a single proof.
type VerifiableBatch struct {
  // Packets are ordered IRCP packets. There may be no gaps in sequence numbers.
  Packets []Packet `json:"packets"`
  // Proof is the proof for the given packets.
  Proof Proof `json:"proof"`
}
```

### Runtime Queries

Each runtime supporting IRCP needs to provide the following query methods for
any given round.

* `ircp.Connections() -> Vec<Connection>` returns the set of connections that
  the runtime should establish with other runtimes.

* `ircp.OutgoingPackets() -> Vec<Packet>` returns the set of packets that need
  to be delivered to destination runtimes.

TODO: queries for sequence numbers so the node can batch properly

Runtime support for IRCP is indicated by having a module named `ircp` reported
in the `core.RuntimeInfo` query response. In case the module is not present,
IRCP support for that runtime should be disabled by the host.

### Fee Payments

Instead of relayers paying for the transport of messages, the channel should do
so. Each runtime implementing IRCP must make it possible for channels to have
a balance used for paying fees of processing incoming messages. Exact payment
semantics are up to the runtime.

### Transport

In order to avoid the need for additional external processes that would perform
relaying of packets between runtimes, existing Oasis Core compute committee
nodes are in charge of performing IRCP transport functions.

A new P2P pubsub topic kind named `ircp` is added (in addition to existing
`committee` and `tx` topics). Each node hosting a runtime will join the topic
for:

* the locally hosted runtime (for incoming and outgoing packets) and;
* any _destination_ runtimes returned by the `ircp.Connections` query (for
  outgoing packets only).

The `ircp` topic accepts serialized `VerifiableBatch` messages, each
representing a batch of packets that should be delivered to the runtime the
topic is for.

#### Outgoing Packet Processing

TODO: Packet

#### Incoming Packet Processing

For locally hosted runtimes the `VerifiableBatch` messages are delivered to the
node's runtime transaction pool and are checked and placed into a special IRCP
queue.

A new IRCP queue is added to the transaction pool. The queue is aware of IRCP
semantics and performs verification (via the usual runtime transaction checks)
and ordering of packets.

#### Acknowledgements

TODO
- acks are sent after receiving and processing a batch of packets
- multiple packets may be acked in a block
- in case no outgoing packets are going back (e.g. no results), an empty ack
  packet should be sent
- when an ack is processed, the corresponding packets are removed

### SDK Module

A new Oasis SDK module named `ircp` would be introduced to handle the runtime
aspects of IRCP.

#### Connections

#### Channels

#### Flows

## Consequences

> This section describes the consequences, after applying the decision. All
> consequences should be summarized here, not just the "positive" ones.

### Positive

- Moving assets and calling applications/smart contracts between runtimes
  becomes possible.

### Negative

- Additional complexity is introduced into the runtime transaction pool, P2P
  pubsub mechanism and the runtime SDK.

### Neutral
